# [Chlorine]()
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Polytonic/Chlorine.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Polytonic/Chlorine)  

## Summary
Chlorine is a collection of OpenCL utilities to help rapidly prototype parallel processing on graphics processing units.  Chlorine aims to provide a fully functional, generic host, enabling users to focus purely on writing kernels without having to worry about writing boilerplate to connect system and device memory.  Chlorine helpfully displays human-readable exceptions for when things do go horribly wrong.
