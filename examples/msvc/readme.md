## [Chlorine](https://github.com/Polytonic/) :: [Visual Studio](https://github.com/Polytonic/Chlorine/tree/master/examples/msvc)

This is a sample Visual Studio Project Solution that demonstrates the `swap` example. It should run out of the box under Windows, as long as you have a valid OpenCL installation for your platform and device manufacturer. If your installation differs from the defaults, you will likely need to change the include paths in order for Chlorine to build properly.
